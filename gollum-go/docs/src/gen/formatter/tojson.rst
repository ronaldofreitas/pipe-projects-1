ToJSON
======

This formatter converts metadata to JSON and stores it where applied.




Parameters
----------

**Root**

  The metadata key to transform to json. When left empty, all
  metadata is assumed. By default this is set to ''.
  
  

**Ignore**

  A list of keys or paths to exclude from marshalling.
  please note that this is currently a quite expensive operation as
  all metadata below root is cloned during the process.
  By default this is set to an empty list.
  
  

Parameters (from core.SimpleFormatter)
--------------------------------------

**Source**

  This value chooses the part of the message the data to be formatted
  should be read from. Use "" to target the message payload; other values
  specify the name of a metadata field to target.
  By default this parameter is set to "".
  
  

**Target**

  This value chooses the part of the message the formatted data
  should be stored to. Use "" to target the message payload; other values
  specify the name of a metadata field to target.
  By default this parameter is set to "".
  
  

**ApplyTo**

  Use this to set Source and Target to the same value. This setting
  will be ignored if either Source or Target is set to something else but "".
  By default this parameter is set to "".
  
  

**SkipIfEmpty**

  When set to true, this formatter will not be applied to data
  that is empty or - in case of metadata - not existing.
  By default this parameter is set to false
  
  

Examples
--------

This example transforms all metadata below the "foo" key to JSON and
stores the result as the new payload.
