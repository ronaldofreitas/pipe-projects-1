Redis
=====

This producer sends messages to a redis server. Different redis storage types
and database indexes are supported. This producer does not implement support
for redis 3.0 cluster.




Parameters
----------

**Enable** (default: true)

  Switches this plugin on or off.
  

**Address**

  Stores the identifier to connect to.
  This can either be any ip address and port like "localhost:6379" or a file
  like "unix:///var/redis.socket". By default this is set to ":6379".
  
  

**Database** (default: 0)

  Defines the redis database to connect to.
  
  

**Key**

  Defines the redis key to store the values in.
  This field is ignored when "KeyFormatter" is set.
  By default this is set to "default".
  
  

**Storage**

  Defines the type of the storage to use. Valid values are: "hash",
  "list", "set", "sortedset", "string". By default this is set to "hash".
  
  

**KeyFrom**

  Defines the name of the metadata field used as a key for messages
  sent to redis. If the name is an empty string no key is sent. By default
  this value is set to an empty string.
  
  

**FieldFrom**

  Defines the name of the metadata field used as a field for messages
  sent to redis. If the name is an empty string no key is sent. By default
  this value is set to an empty string.
  
  

**Password**

  (no documentation available)
  

Parameters (from core.BufferedProducer)
---------------------------------------

**Channel**

  This value defines the capacity of the message buffer.
  By default this parameter is set to "8192".
  
  

**ChannelTimeoutMs** (default: 0, unit: ms)

  This value defines a timeout for each message
  before the message will discarded. To disable the timeout, set this
  parameter to 0.
  By default this parameter is set to "0".
  
  

Parameters (from core.SimpleProducer)
-------------------------------------

**Streams**

  Defines a list of streams the producer will receive from. This
  parameter is mandatory. Specifying "*" causes the producer to receive messages
  from all streams except internal internal ones (e.g. _GOLLUM_).
  By default this parameter is set to an empty list.
  
  

**FallbackStream**

  Defines a stream to route messages to if delivery fails.
  The message is reset to its original state before being routed, i.e. all
  modifications done to the message after leaving the consumer are removed.
  Setting this paramater to "" will cause messages to be discared when delivery
  fails.
  
  

**ShutdownTimeoutMs** (default: 1000, unit: ms)

  Defines the maximum time in milliseconds a producer is
  allowed to take to shut down. After this timeout the producer is always
  considered to have shut down.  Decreasing this value may lead to lost
  messages during shutdown. Raising it may increase shutdown time.
  
  

**Modulators**

  Defines a list of modulators to be applied to a message when
  it arrives at this producer. If a modulator changes the stream of a message
  the message is NOT routed to this stream anymore.
  By default this parameter is set to an empty list.
