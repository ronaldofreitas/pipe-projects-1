Proxy
=====

This producer is a compatible with the Proxy consumer plugin.
Responses to messages sent to the given address are sent back to the original
consumer of it is a compatible message source. As with consumer.proxy the
returned messages are partitioned by common message length algorithms.




Parameters
----------

**Enable** (default: true)

  Switches this plugin on or off.
  

**Address**

  This value stores the identifier to connect to.
  This can either be any ip address and port like "localhost:5880" or a file
  like "unix:///var/gollum.Proxy".
  By default this parameter is set to ":5880".
  
  

**ConnectionBufferSizeKB** (default: 1024, unit: mb)

  This value sets the connection buffer size in KB.
  This also defines the size of the buffer used by the message parser.
  By default this parameter is set to "1024".
  
  

**TimeoutSec** (default: 1, unit: sec)

  This value defines the maximum time in seconds a client is allowed to take
  for a response.
  By default this parameter is set to "1".
  
  

**Partitioner**

  This value defines the algorithm used to read messages from the stream.
  The messages will be sent as a whole, no cropping or removal will take place.
  By default this parameter is set to "delimiter".
  
  

  **delimiter**

    separates messages by looking for a delimiter string. The
    delimiter is included into the left hand message.
    
    

  **ascii**

    reads an ASCII encoded number at a given offset until a given
    delimiter is found.
    
    

  **binary**

    reads a binary number at a given offset and size
    
    

  **binary_le**

    is an alias for "binary"
    
    

  **binary_be**

    is the same as "binary" but uses big endian encoding
    
    

  **fixed**

    assumes fixed size messages
    
    

**Delimiter**

  This value defines the delimiter used by the text and delimiter partitioner.
  By default this parameter is set to "\n".
  
  

**Offset**

  This value defines the offset used by the binary and text partitioner.
  This setting is ignored by the fixed partitioner.
  By default this parameter is set to "0".
  
  

**Size**

  This value defines the size in bytes used by the binary or fixed partitioner.
  For `binary` this can be set to 1,2,4 or 8,  for `fixed` this defines the size of a message.
  BY default this parameter is set to "4" for `binary` or "1" for `fixed` partitioner.
  
  

Parameters (from core.BufferedProducer)
---------------------------------------

**Channel**

  This value defines the capacity of the message buffer.
  By default this parameter is set to "8192".
  
  

**ChannelTimeoutMs** (default: 0, unit: ms)

  This value defines a timeout for each message
  before the message will discarded. To disable the timeout, set this
  parameter to 0.
  By default this parameter is set to "0".
  
  

Parameters (from core.SimpleProducer)
-------------------------------------

**Streams**

  Defines a list of streams the producer will receive from. This
  parameter is mandatory. Specifying "*" causes the producer to receive messages
  from all streams except internal internal ones (e.g. _GOLLUM_).
  By default this parameter is set to an empty list.
  
  

**FallbackStream**

  Defines a stream to route messages to if delivery fails.
  The message is reset to its original state before being routed, i.e. all
  modifications done to the message after leaving the consumer are removed.
  Setting this paramater to "" will cause messages to be discared when delivery
  fails.
  
  

**ShutdownTimeoutMs** (default: 1000, unit: ms)

  Defines the maximum time in milliseconds a producer is
  allowed to take to shut down. After this timeout the producer is always
  considered to have shut down.  Decreasing this value may lead to lost
  messages during shutdown. Raising it may increase shutdown time.
  
  

**Modulators**

  Defines a list of modulators to be applied to a message when
  it arrives at this producer. If a modulator changes the stream of a message
  the message is NOT routed to this stream anymore.
  By default this parameter is set to an empty list.
  
  

Examples
--------

This example will send 64bit length encoded data on TCP port 5880.
