AwsFirehose
===========

This producer sends data to an AWS Firehose stream.




Parameters
----------

**Enable** (default: true)

  Switches this plugin on or off.
  

**StreamMapping**

  This value defines a translation from gollum stream names
  to firehose stream names. If no mapping is given, the gollum stream name is
  used as the firehose stream name.
  By default this parameter is set to "empty"
  
  

**RecordMaxMessages** (default: 1)

  This value defines the number of messages to send
  in one record to aws firehose.
  By default this parameter is set to "1".
  
  

**RecordMessageDelimiter** (default: \n)

  This value defines the delimiter string to use between
  messages within a firehose record.
  By default this parameter is set to "\n".
  
  

**SendTimeframeMs** (default: 1000, unit: ms)

  This value defines the timeframe in milliseconds in which a second
  batch send can be triggered.
  By default this parameter is set to "1000".
  
  

Parameters (from components.AwsCredentials)
-------------------------------------------

**Credential/Type** (default: none)

  This value defines the credentials that are to be used when
  connecting to aws. Available values are listed below. See
  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/aws/credentials/#Credentials
  for more information.
  
  

  **environment**

    Retrieves credentials from the environment variables of
    the running process
    
    

  **static**

    Retrieves credentials value for individual credential fields
    
    

  **shared**

    Retrieves credentials from the current user's home directory
    
    

  **none**

    Use a anonymous login to aws
    
    

**Credential/Id**

  is used for "static" type and is used as the AccessKeyID
  
  

**Credential/Token**

  is used for "static" type and is used as the SessionToken
  
  

**Credential/Secret**

  is used for "static" type and is used as the SecretAccessKey
  
  

**Credential/File**

  is used for "shared" type and is used as the path to your
  shared Credentials file (~/.aws/credentials)
  
  

**Credential/Profile** (default: default)

  is used for "shared" type and is used for the profile
  
  

**Credential/AssumeRole**

  This value is used to assume an IAM role using.
  By default this is set to "".
  
  

Parameters (from components.AwsMultiClient)
-------------------------------------------

**Region** (default: us-east-1)

  This value defines the used aws region.
  By default this is set to "us-east-1"
  
  

**Endpoint**

  This value defines the used aws api endpoint. If no endpoint is set
  the client needs to set the right endpoint for the used region.
  By default this is set to "".
  
  

Parameters (from core.BatchedProducer)
--------------------------------------

**Batch/MaxCount** (default: 8192)

  Defines the maximum number of messages per batch. If this
  limit is reached a flush is always triggered.
  By default this parameter is set to 8192.
  
  

**Batch/FlushCount** (default: 4096)

  Defines the minimum number of messages required to flush
  a batch. If this limit is reached a flush might be triggered.
  By default this parameter is set to 4096.
  
  

**Batch/TimeoutSec** (default: 5, unit: sec)

  Defines the maximum time in seconds messages can stay in
  the internal buffer before being flushed.
  By default this parameter is set to 5.
  
  

Parameters (from core.SimpleProducer)
-------------------------------------

**Streams**

  Defines a list of streams the producer will receive from. This
  parameter is mandatory. Specifying "*" causes the producer to receive messages
  from all streams except internal internal ones (e.g. _GOLLUM_).
  By default this parameter is set to an empty list.
  
  

**FallbackStream**

  Defines a stream to route messages to if delivery fails.
  The message is reset to its original state before being routed, i.e. all
  modifications done to the message after leaving the consumer are removed.
  Setting this paramater to "" will cause messages to be discared when delivery
  fails.
  
  

**ShutdownTimeoutMs** (default: 1000, unit: ms)

  Defines the maximum time in milliseconds a producer is
  allowed to take to shut down. After this timeout the producer is always
  considered to have shut down.  Decreasing this value may lead to lost
  messages during shutdown. Raising it may increase shutdown time.
  
  

**Modulators**

  Defines a list of modulators to be applied to a message when
  it arrives at this producer. If a modulator changes the stream of a message
  the message is NOT routed to this stream anymore.
  By default this parameter is set to an empty list.
  
  

Examples
--------

This example set up a simple aws firehose producer:

.. code-block:: yaml

	 firehoseOut:
	   Type: producer.AwsFirehose
	   Streams: "*"
	   StreamMapping:
	     "*": default
	   Credential:
	     Type: shared
	     File: /Users/<USERNAME>/.aws/credentials
	     Profile: default
	   Region: eu-west-1
	   RecordMaxMessages: 1
	   RecordMessageDelimiter: "\n"
	   SendTimeframeSec: 1
