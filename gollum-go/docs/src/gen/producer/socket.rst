Socket
======

The socket producer connects to a service over TCP, UDP or a UNIX domain
socket.




Parameters
----------

**Enable** (default: true)

  Switches this plugin on or off.
  

**Address**

  Defines the address to connect to. This can either be any ip
  address and port like "localhost:5880" or a file like "unix:///var/gollum.socket".
  By default this parameter is set to ":5880".
  
  

**ConnectionBufferSizeKB** (default: 1024, unit: kb)

  This value sets the connection buffer size in KB.
  By default this parameter is set to "1024".
  
  

**Batch/MaxCount** (default: 8192)

  This value defines the maximum number of messages that can be buffered
  before a flush is mandatory. If the buffer is full and a flush is still
  underway or cannot be triggered out of other reasons, the producer will block.
  By default this parameter is set to "8192".
  
  

**Batch/FlushCount** (default: 4096)

  This value defines the number of messages to be buffered before they are
  written to disk. This setting is clamped to BatchMaxCount.
  By default this parameter is set to "Batch/MaxCount / 2".
  
  

**Batch/TimeoutSec** (default: 5, unit: sec)

  This value defines the maximum number of seconds to wait after the last
  message arrived before a batch is flushed automatically.
  By default this parameter is set to "5".
  
  

**Acknowledge**

  This value can be set to a non-empty value to expect the given string as a
  response from the server after a batch has been sent.
  If Acknowledge is enabled and a IP-Address is given to Address, TCP is used
  to open the connection, otherwise UDP is used.
  By default this parameter is set to "".
  
  

**AckTimeoutMs** (default: 2000, unit: ms)

  This value defines the time in milliseconds to wait for a response from the
  server. After this timeout the send is marked as failed.
  By default this parameter is set to "2000".
  
  

Parameters (from core.BufferedProducer)
---------------------------------------

**Channel**

  This value defines the capacity of the message buffer.
  By default this parameter is set to "8192".
  
  

**ChannelTimeoutMs** (default: 0, unit: ms)

  This value defines a timeout for each message
  before the message will discarded. To disable the timeout, set this
  parameter to 0.
  By default this parameter is set to "0".
  
  

Parameters (from core.SimpleProducer)
-------------------------------------

**Streams**

  Defines a list of streams the producer will receive from. This
  parameter is mandatory. Specifying "*" causes the producer to receive messages
  from all streams except internal internal ones (e.g. _GOLLUM_).
  By default this parameter is set to an empty list.
  
  

**FallbackStream**

  Defines a stream to route messages to if delivery fails.
  The message is reset to its original state before being routed, i.e. all
  modifications done to the message after leaving the consumer are removed.
  Setting this paramater to "" will cause messages to be discared when delivery
  fails.
  
  

**ShutdownTimeoutMs** (default: 1000, unit: ms)

  Defines the maximum time in milliseconds a producer is
  allowed to take to shut down. After this timeout the producer is always
  considered to have shut down.  Decreasing this value may lead to lost
  messages during shutdown. Raising it may increase shutdown time.
  
  

**Modulators**

  Defines a list of modulators to be applied to a message when
  it arrives at this producer. If a modulator changes the stream of a message
  the message is NOT routed to this stream anymore.
  By default this parameter is set to an empty list.
  
  

Examples
--------

This example starts a socket producer on localhost port 5880:

.. code-block:: yaml

	 SocketOut:
	   Type: producer.Socket
	   Address: ":5880"
	   Batch
	     MaxCount: 1024
	     FlushCount: 512
	     TimeoutSec: 3
	   AckTimeoutMs: 1000
