Console
=======

This consumer reads from stdin or a named pipe. A message is generated after
each newline character.




Metadata
--------

*NOTE: The metadata will only set if the parameter `SetMetadata` is active.*


**pipe**

  Name of the pipe the message was received on (set)
  
  

Parameters
----------

**Enable** (default: true)

  Switches this plugin on or off.
  

**Pipe** (default: stdin)

  Defines the pipe to read from. This can be "stdin" or the path
  to a named pipe. If the named pipe doesn't exist, it will be created.
  By default this paramater is set to "stdin".
  
  

**Permissions** (default: 0644)

  Defines the UNIX filesystem permissions used when creating
  the named pipe as an octal number.
  By default this paramater is set to "0664".
  
  

**ExitOnEOF** (default: true)

  If set to true, the plusing triggers an exit signal if the
  pipe is closed, i.e. when EOF is detected.
  By default this paramater is set to "true".
  
  

**SetMetadata** (default: false)

  When this value is set to "true", the fields mentioned in the metadata
  section will be added to each message. Adding metadata will have a
  performance impact on systems with high throughput.
  By default this parameter is set to "false".
  
  

Parameters (from core.SimpleConsumer)
-------------------------------------

**Streams**

  Defines a list of streams a consumer will send to. This parameter
  is mandatory. When using "*" messages will be sent only to the internal "*"
  stream. It will NOT send messages to all streams.
  By default this parameter is set to an empty list.
  
  

**ShutdownTimeoutMs** (default: 1000, unit: ms)

  Defines the maximum time in milliseconds a consumer is
  allowed to take to shut down. After this timeout the consumer is always
  considered to have shut down.
  By default this parameter is set to 1000.
  
  

**Modulators**

  Defines a list of modulators to be applied to a message before
  it is sent to the list of streams. If a modulator specifies a stream, the
  message is only sent to that specific stream. A message is saved as original
  after all modulators have been applied.
  By default this parameter is set to an empty list.
  
  

**ModulatorRoutines**

  Defines the number of go routines reserved for
  modulating messages. Setting this parameter to 0 will use as many go routines
  as the specific consumer plugin is using for fetching data. Any other value
  will force the given number fo go routines to be used.
  By default this parameter is set to 0
  
  

**ModulatorQueueSize**

  Defines the size of the channel used to buffer messages
  before they are fetched by the next free modulator go routine. If the
  ModulatorRoutines parameter is set to 0 this parameter is ignored.
  By default this parameter is set to 1024.
  
  

Examples
--------

This config reads data from stdin e.g. when starting gollum via unix pipe.
