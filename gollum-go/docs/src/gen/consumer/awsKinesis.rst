Parameters
----------

**Enable** (default: true)

  Switches this plugin on or off.
  

**KinesisStream** (default: default)

  This value defines the stream to read from.
  By default this parameter is set to "default".
  
  

**OffsetFile**

  This value defines a file to store the current offset per shard.
  To disable this parameter, set it to "". If the parameter is set and the file
  is found, consuming will start after the offset stored in the file.
  By default this parameter is set to "".
  
  

**RecordsPerQuery** (default: 100)

  This value defines the number of records to pull per query.
  By default this parameter is set to "100".
  
  

**RecordMessageDelimiter**

  This value defines the string to delimit messages
  within a record. To disable this parameter, set it to "".
  By default this parameter is set to "".
  
  

**QuerySleepTimeMs** (default: 1000, unit: ms)

  This value defines the number of milliseconds to sleep
  before trying to pull new records from a shard that did not return any records.
  By default this parameter is set to "1000".
  
  

**RetrySleepTimeSec**

  This value defines the number of seconds to wait after
  trying to reconnect to a shard.
  By default this parameter is set to "4".
  
  

**CheckNewShardsSec** (default: 0, unit: sec)

  This value sets a timer to update shards in Kinesis.
  You can set this parameter to "0" for disabling.
  By default this parameter is set to "0".
  
  

**DefaultOffset**

  This value defines the message index to start reading from.
  Valid values are either "newest", "oldest", or a number.
  By default this parameter is set to "newest".
  
  

Parameters (from components.AwsCredentials)
-------------------------------------------

**Credential/Type** (default: none)

  This value defines the credentials that are to be used when
  connecting to aws. Available values are listed below. See
  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/aws/credentials/#Credentials
  for more information.
  
  

  **environment**

    Retrieves credentials from the environment variables of
    the running process
    
    

  **static**

    Retrieves credentials value for individual credential fields
    
    

  **shared**

    Retrieves credentials from the current user's home directory
    
    

  **none**

    Use a anonymous login to aws
    
    

**Credential/Id**

  is used for "static" type and is used as the AccessKeyID
  
  

**Credential/Token**

  is used for "static" type and is used as the SessionToken
  
  

**Credential/Secret**

  is used for "static" type and is used as the SecretAccessKey
  
  

**Credential/File**

  is used for "shared" type and is used as the path to your
  shared Credentials file (~/.aws/credentials)
  
  

**Credential/Profile** (default: default)

  is used for "shared" type and is used for the profile
  
  

**Credential/AssumeRole**

  This value is used to assume an IAM role using.
  By default this is set to "".
  
  

Parameters (from components.AwsMultiClient)
-------------------------------------------

**Region** (default: us-east-1)

  This value defines the used aws region.
  By default this is set to "us-east-1"
  
  

**Endpoint**

  This value defines the used aws api endpoint. If no endpoint is set
  the client needs to set the right endpoint for the used region.
  By default this is set to "".
  
  

Parameters (from core.SimpleConsumer)
-------------------------------------

**Streams**

  Defines a list of streams a consumer will send to. This parameter
  is mandatory. When using "*" messages will be sent only to the internal "*"
  stream. It will NOT send messages to all streams.
  By default this parameter is set to an empty list.
  
  

**ShutdownTimeoutMs** (default: 1000, unit: ms)

  Defines the maximum time in milliseconds a consumer is
  allowed to take to shut down. After this timeout the consumer is always
  considered to have shut down.
  By default this parameter is set to 1000.
  
  

**Modulators**

  Defines a list of modulators to be applied to a message before
  it is sent to the list of streams. If a modulator specifies a stream, the
  message is only sent to that specific stream. A message is saved as original
  after all modulators have been applied.
  By default this parameter is set to an empty list.
  
  

**ModulatorRoutines**

  Defines the number of go routines reserved for
  modulating messages. Setting this parameter to 0 will use as many go routines
  as the specific consumer plugin is using for fetching data. Any other value
  will force the given number fo go routines to be used.
  By default this parameter is set to 0
  
  

**ModulatorQueueSize**

  Defines the size of the channel used to buffer messages
  before they are fetched by the next free modulator go routine. If the
  ModulatorRoutines parameter is set to 0 this parameter is ignored.
  By default this parameter is set to 1024.
  
  

Examples
--------

This example consumes a kinesis stream "myStream" and create messages:

.. code-block:: yaml

	 KinesisIn:
	   Type: consumer.AwsKinesis
	   Credential:
	     Type: shared
	     File: /Users/<USERNAME>/.aws/credentials
	     Profile: default
	   Region: "eu-west-1"
	   KinesisStream: myStream
