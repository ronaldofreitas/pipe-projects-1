Proxy
=====

This consumer reads messages from a given socket like consumer.Socket but
allows reverse communication, too. Producers which require this kind of
communication can access message.GetSource to write data back to the client
sending the message. See producer.Proxy as an example target producer.




Parameters
----------

**Enable** (default: true)

  Switches this plugin on or off.
  

**Address**

  Defines the protocol, host and port or the unix domain socket to
  listen to. This can either be any ip address and port like "localhost:5880"
  or a file like "unix:///var/gollum.socket". Only unix and tcp protocols are
  supported.
  By default this parameter is set to ":5880".
  
  

**Partitioner**

  Defines the algorithm used to read messages from the router.
  The messages will be sent as a whole, no cropping or removal will take place.
  By default this parameter is set to "delimiter".
  
  

  **delimiter**

    Separates messages by looking for a delimiter string.
    The delimiter is removed from the message.
    
    

  **ascii**

    Reads an ASCII number at a given offset until a given delimiter is
    found. Everything to the left of and including the delimiter is removed
    from the message.
    
    

  **binary**

    reads a binary number at a given offset and size.
    The number is removed from the message.
    
    

  **binary_le**

    is an alias for "binary".
    
    

  **binary_be**

    acts like "binary"_le but uses big endian encoding.
    
    

  **fixed**

    assumes fixed size messages.
    
    

**Delimiter** (default: \n)

  Defines the delimiter string used to separate messages if
  partitioner is set to "delimiter" or the string used to separate the message
  length if partitioner is set to "ascii".
  By default this parameter is set to "\n".
  
  

**Offset** (default: 0)

  Defines an offset in bytes used to read the length provided for
  partitioner "binary" and "ascii".
  By default this parameter is set to 0.
  
  

**Size** (default: 4)

  Defines the size of the length prefix used by partitioner "binary"
  or the message total size when using partitioner "fixed".
  When using partitioner "binary" this parameter can be set to 1,2,4 or 8 when
  using uint8,uint16,uint32 or uint64 length prefixes.
  By default this parameter is set to 4.
  
  

Parameters (from core.SimpleConsumer)
-------------------------------------

**Streams**

  Defines a list of streams a consumer will send to. This parameter
  is mandatory. When using "*" messages will be sent only to the internal "*"
  stream. It will NOT send messages to all streams.
  By default this parameter is set to an empty list.
  
  

**ShutdownTimeoutMs** (default: 1000, unit: ms)

  Defines the maximum time in milliseconds a consumer is
  allowed to take to shut down. After this timeout the consumer is always
  considered to have shut down.
  By default this parameter is set to 1000.
  
  

**Modulators**

  Defines a list of modulators to be applied to a message before
  it is sent to the list of streams. If a modulator specifies a stream, the
  message is only sent to that specific stream. A message is saved as original
  after all modulators have been applied.
  By default this parameter is set to an empty list.
  
  

**ModulatorRoutines**

  Defines the number of go routines reserved for
  modulating messages. Setting this parameter to 0 will use as many go routines
  as the specific consumer plugin is using for fetching data. Any other value
  will force the given number fo go routines to be used.
  By default this parameter is set to 0
  
  

**ModulatorQueueSize**

  Defines the size of the channel used to buffer messages
  before they are fetched by the next free modulator go routine. If the
  ModulatorRoutines parameter is set to 0 this parameter is ignored.
  By default this parameter is set to 1024.
  
  

Examples
--------

This example will accepts 64bit length encoded data on TCP port 5880.
