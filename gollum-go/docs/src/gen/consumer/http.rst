HTTP
====

This consumer opens up an HTTP 1.1 server and processes the contents of any
incoming HTTP request.




Parameters
----------

**Enable** (default: true)

  Switches this plugin on or off.
  

**Address** (default: :80)

  Defines the TCP port and optional IP address to listen on.
  Sets http.Server.Addr; for defails, see its Go documentation.
  Syntax: [hostname|address]:<port>
  
  

**ReadTimeoutSec** (default: 3, unit: sec)

  Defines the maximum duration in seconds before timing out
  the HTTP read request. Sets http.Server.ReadTimeout; for details, see its
  Go documentation.
  
  

**WithHeaders** (default: true)

  If true, relays the complete HTTP request to the generated
  Gollum message. If false, relays only the HTTP request body and ignores
  headers.
  
  

**Htpasswd**

  Path to an htpasswd-formatted password file. If defined, turns
  on HTTP Basic Authentication in the server.
  
  

**BasicRealm**

  Defines the Authentication Realm for HTTP Basic Authentication.
  Meaningful only in conjunction with Htpasswd.
  
  

**Certificate**

  Path to an X509 formatted certificate file. If defined, turns on
  SSL/TLS  support in the HTTP server. Requires PrivateKey to be set.
  
  

**PrivateKey**

  Path to an X509 formatted private key file. Meaningful only in
  conjunction with Certificate.
  
  

Parameters (from core.SimpleConsumer)
-------------------------------------

**Streams**

  Defines a list of streams a consumer will send to. This parameter
  is mandatory. When using "*" messages will be sent only to the internal "*"
  stream. It will NOT send messages to all streams.
  By default this parameter is set to an empty list.
  
  

**ShutdownTimeoutMs** (default: 1000, unit: ms)

  Defines the maximum time in milliseconds a consumer is
  allowed to take to shut down. After this timeout the consumer is always
  considered to have shut down.
  By default this parameter is set to 1000.
  
  

**Modulators**

  Defines a list of modulators to be applied to a message before
  it is sent to the list of streams. If a modulator specifies a stream, the
  message is only sent to that specific stream. A message is saved as original
  after all modulators have been applied.
  By default this parameter is set to an empty list.
  
  

**ModulatorRoutines**

  Defines the number of go routines reserved for
  modulating messages. Setting this parameter to 0 will use as many go routines
  as the specific consumer plugin is using for fetching data. Any other value
  will force the given number fo go routines to be used.
  By default this parameter is set to 0
  
  

**ModulatorQueueSize**

  Defines the size of the channel used to buffer messages
  before they are fetched by the next free modulator go routine. If the
  ModulatorRoutines parameter is set to 0 this parameter is ignored.
  By default this parameter is set to 1024.
  
  

Examples
--------

This example listens on port 9090 and writes to the stream "http_in_00".

.. code-block:: yaml

	  "HttpIn00":
	    Type: "consumer.HTTP"
	    Streams: "http_in_00"
