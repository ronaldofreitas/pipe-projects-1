RoundRobin
==========

This router implements round robin routing. Messages are routed to
exactly one of the producers registered to the given stream. The
producer is switched in a round robin fashin after each message.
This producer can be useful for load balancing, e.g. when the target service
does not support sharding by itself.




Parameters
----------

**Enable** (default: true)

  Switches this plugin on or off.
  

Parameters (from core.SimpleRouter)
-----------------------------------

**Stream**

  This value specifies the name of the stream this plugin is supposed to
  read messages from.
  
  

**Filters**

  This value defines an optional list of Filter plugins to connect to
  this router.
  
  

**TimeoutMs** (default: 0, unit: ms)

  This value sets a timeout in milliseconds until a message should
  handled by the router. You can disable this behavior by setting it to "0".
  By default this parameter is set to "0".
  
  

Examples
--------

This example will send message to the two console producers in an alternating
fashin.
