Distribute
==========

The "Distribute" plugin provides 1:n stream remapping by duplicating
messages.

During startup, it creates a set of streams with names listed
in [TargetStreams]. During execution, it consumes messages from
the stream [Stream] and enqueues copies of these messages onto
each of the streams listed in [TargetStreams].

When routing to multiple routers, the incoming stream has to be listed
explicitly to be used.




Parameters
----------

**Enable** (default: true)

  Switches this plugin on or off.
  

**TargetStreams**

  List of streams to route the incoming messages to.
  
  

Parameters (from core.SimpleRouter)
-----------------------------------

**Stream**

  This value specifies the name of the stream this plugin is supposed to
  read messages from.
  
  

**Filters**

  This value defines an optional list of Filter plugins to connect to
  this router.
  
  

**TimeoutMs** (default: 0, unit: ms)

  This value sets a timeout in milliseconds until a message should
  handled by the router. You can disable this behavior by setting it to "0".
  By default this parameter is set to "0".
  
  

Examples
--------

This example route incoming messages from `streamA` to `streamB` and `streamC` (duplication):

.. code-block:: yaml

	 JunkRouterDist:
	   Type: router.Distribute
	   Stream: streamA
	   TargetStreams:
	     - streamB
	     - streamC
