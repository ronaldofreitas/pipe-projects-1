Random
======

The "Random" router relays each message sent to the stream [Stream] to
exactly one of the producers connected to [Stream]. The receiving producer
is chosen randomly for each message.




Parameters
----------

**Enable** (default: true)

  Switches this plugin on or off.
  

Parameters (from core.SimpleRouter)
-----------------------------------

**Stream**

  This value specifies the name of the stream this plugin is supposed to
  read messages from.
  
  

**Filters**

  This value defines an optional list of Filter plugins to connect to
  this router.
  
  

**TimeoutMs** (default: 0, unit: ms)

  This value sets a timeout in milliseconds until a message should
  handled by the router. You can disable this behavior by setting it to "0".
  By default this parameter is set to "0".
  
  

Examples
--------

This example will randomly send messages to one of the two console producers.
