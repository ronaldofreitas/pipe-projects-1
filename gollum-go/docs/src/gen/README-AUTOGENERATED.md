# AUTOGENERATED CONTENT

All content under `docs/src/gen/` is automatically generated:

- `docs/src/gen/\*/index.rst` are created by docs/Makefile
- `docs/src/gen/\*/\*.rst` (except `index.rst`) are created by the
  docs generator (`docs/generator/\*.go`) from plugins' `*.go`
  sources via docs/Makefile

To edit the .rst files' contents, edit comments in the plugins.
