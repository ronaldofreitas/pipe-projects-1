Sample
======

This plugin can be used to get n out of m messages (downsample).
This allows you to reduce the amount of messages; the plugin starts
blocking after a certain number of messages has been reached.




Parameters
----------

**SampleRatePerGroup** (default: 1)

  This value defines how many messages are passed through
  the filter in each group.
  By default this parameter is set to "1".
  
  

**SampleGroupSize** (default: 2)

  This value defines how many messages make up a group. Messages over
  SampleRatePerGroup within a group are filtered.
  By default this parameter is set to "2".
  
  

**SampleRateIgnore**

  This value defines a list of streams that should not be affected by
  sampling. This is useful for e.g. producers listening to "*".
  By default this parameter is set to an empty list.
  
  

Examples
--------

This example will block 8 from 10 messages:

.. code-block:: yaml

	 exampleConsumer:
	   Type: consumer.Console
	   Streams: "*"
	   Modulators:
	     - filter.Sample:
	       SampleRatePerGroup: 2
	       SampleGroupSize: 10
	       SampleIgnore:
	         - foo
	         - bar
