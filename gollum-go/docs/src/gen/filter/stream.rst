Stream
======

The "Stream" filter filters messages by applying black and white lists
to the the messages' streams' names.

The blacklist is applied first; messages not rejected by the blacklist
are checked against the whitelist. An empty white list matches all
streams.




Parameters
----------

**Block**

  Defines a list of stream names that are blocked. If a message's
  stream is not in that list, the "Only" list is tested. By default this
  parameter is empty.
  
  

**Only**

  Defines a list of streams that may pass. Messages from streams
  that are not in this list are blocked unless the list is empty.
  By default this parameter is empty.
  
  

Parameters (from core.SimpleFilter)
-----------------------------------

**FilteredStream**

  This value defines the stream filtered messages get sent to.
  You can disable this behavior by setting the value to "".
  By default this parameter is set to "".
